# Agriceco-Syetem
To Finance Farmers and create a stimulus and vibrancy within the Agriculture sector of Nigerias ecconomy

Hello There!

I Moses Chimaraoke Vincent
I have always asked questions to the Supreme Being (Almighty God) why i was created in Nigeria, and why he has given me the kind of heat i have, which is not been able to withstand oppression of any kind on humanity, as such i feel in my deepest soul that i am called to librate men out of the hands of evil minded leaders of today and turn them into the PROVIDENCE of God. This is who i am, an this reason has made me to begin this journey, to finance the Farmers in this Agriceco-system.
